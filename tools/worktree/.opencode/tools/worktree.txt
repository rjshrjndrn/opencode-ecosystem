Manage git worktrees to work on multiple branches simultaneously without stashing or committing incomplete work.

This tool provides operations to:
- List all existing worktrees with their branches and paths
- Create new worktrees with automatic branch creation
- Remove worktrees cleanly (including their branches)
- Switch between worktrees by changing directory

Worktrees are useful for:
- Code reviews (checkout PR branches in isolation)
- Hotfixes (work on urgent fixes without disturbing feature work)
- Long-running experiments (try ideas without affecting main work)
- CI/CD testing (verify builds in clean environments)

The main worktree cannot be removed. Branch names are automatically prefixed with 'worktree/' unless explicitly provided with the prefix.
